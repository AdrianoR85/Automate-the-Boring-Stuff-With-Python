# Automate the Boring Stuff with Python Projects

This repository contains projects, exercises, and scripts inspired by the book **[Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/)** by Al Sweigart.

The goal of this project is to practice and reinforce Python programming skills by automating everyday tasks, such as working with files, manipulating spreadsheets, sending emails, and more.

## 📚 About the Book

**Automate the Boring Stuff with Python** teaches how to use Python to automate tedious, repetitive tasks. It covers practical applications like:

- File manipulation
- Web scraping
- Working with Excel and PDFs
- Sending emails and texts
- Automation with GUIs
- And more...

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

## About All Project

### 🧠 Generate Random Quiz Files
This project generates multiple-choice quizzes on U.S. state capitals (or any similar data set), where each quiz is randomly ordered and has a corresponding answer key. It's a great way to practice Python skills like:
- Dictionaries
- File handling
- Loops and logic
- Randomization

The goal is to automate quiz generation for students, teachers, or self-study — making it easy to create unique versions of a quiz with answer keys.
