This repository contains a collection of projects and scripts focused on **automating everyday tasks with Python**. While it was initially inspired by the book [Automate the Boring Stuff with Python](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/) by Al Sweigart, the scope has grown to include personal experiments, studies, and practical tools in Python automation.

## 🎯 Purpose

The goal of this repository is to **practice and reinforce Python programming skills** by building automation scripts that solve real-world problems. These projects involve working with files, organizing folders, generating content, and more.

## 🚀 What You'll Find Here

This repository includes:

- ✅ Projects inspired by the book
- 🧪 Independent automation tools and experiments
- ⚙️ Small utilities to automate boring tasks
- 📝 Notes and personal improvements

## 🧠 Featured Projects

### 📄 File Organizer by Extension

This project automatically organizes files in a directory by their file extensions. It moves each file into a folder named after its extension, helping keep your workspace clean and organized.

**Key Features:**
- Handles files without extensions
- Prevents overwriting by renaming duplicates
- Logs all actions to a log file
- Supports CLI arguments to specify target directory

📁 Example:

```
Before:
Downloads/
├── report.pdf
├── photo.jpg
├── script.py

After:
Downloads/
├── PDF/
│ └── report.pdf
├── JPG/
│ └── photo.jpg
├── PY/
│ └── script.py
```

### 🧠 Generate Random Quiz Files

This project generates multiple-choice quizzes on U.S. state capitals, where each quiz is randomly ordered and has a corresponding answer key.

**Skills Practiced:**
- Working with dictionaries
- File I/O and formatting
- Loops and logic
- Randomization
